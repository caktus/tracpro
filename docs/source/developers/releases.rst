Releases
========

Tracpro's version is incremented upon each merge to master according to our
`deploy process <deployment.rst>`_.

Version number increments follow semantic versioning:

    * The micro version is incremented with backwards-compatible bugfixes.
    * The minor version is incremented with backwards-compatible features.
    * The major version is incremented with incompatible changes.

We recommend reviewing the release notes and code diffs before upgrading
between versions.

v1.0.0 (released 2015-11-18)
----------------------------

* First Caktus release.
